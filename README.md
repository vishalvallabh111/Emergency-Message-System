# Emergency Message System

Developed an android application which can be used to send a user-defined emergency message to a list of saved/new contacts which can include contacts of police and other emergency services.

It uses a Google API to send the location of incident to the emergency contacts.

The application is designed in such a way that the messages would be sent for every pre-entered unit of time until an acknowledgement from any contact is received.
